Introduction: Ludo is a classic board game that involves strategic decision-making and a fair
amount of luck. In this case study, we delve into the application of the minimax or alpha-beta pruning
algorithm to develop an optimized strategy for playing Ludo. The objective is to maximize the
chances of winning while considering the moves of all four players.

Scenario: Imagine you are participating in a high-stakes Ludo tournament against three skilled
opponents. Each player aims to move their pieces around the board and reach the finish line before
their opponents. Your goal is to develop an algorithm that can analyze the current state of the game,
predict future moves, and make the best possible decision to increase your chances of winning.

Objective: Your objective is to implement either the minimax or alpha-beta pruning algorithm to
create an intelligent Ludo player that can compete against human opponents. The algorithm should
consider the moves of all four players and select the most advantageous move for your pieces.

Problem Statement: Given the current state of the Ludo board, including the positions of all
pieces for all players, develop an algorithm to determine the best move for your pieces while
anticipating the moves of your opponents. The algorithm should aim to maximize your chances of
reaching the finish line while minimizing the risk of being sent back to the starting area.
Example:
Let's consider a simplified scenario:
• The Ludo board consists of a square grid with four starting areas, a central circular area, and a
finishing line for each player.
• Each player has four pieces of a unique color.
• Players take turns rolling a die to determine the number of steps their pieces can move.
• The objective is to move all four pieces from the starting area to the finishing line before the
opponents.

Implementation Steps:
1. Board Representation: Define a data structure to represent the current state of the Ludo
board, including the positions of all pieces for all players.
2. Generate Possible Moves: Determine the possible moves that can be made by each piece
based on the current state of the board and the roll of the die.
3. Evaluate Moves: Assign a score to each possible move based on its potential outcome,
considering factors such as the proximity to the finish line and the risk of being captured by
opponents.
4. Minimax or Alpha-Beta Pruning: Implement either the minimax algorithm or alpha-beta
pruning to analyze possible future moves and select the move that maximizes your chances of
winning while considering the moves of all opponents.
5. Optimal Move Selection: Select the move with the highest score as the optimal decision for
the current state of the game.
Conclusion: By implementing the minimax or alpha-beta pruning algorithm, you can develop an
intelligent Ludo player capable of making strategic decisions to outmaneuver human opponents. This
case study highlights the application of algorithmic techniques in the context of board games,
demonstrating the importance of decision-making and predictive analysis in competitive gaming
environments.
